1. **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
3. **Impact**: Description of the potential impact
4. **Environment**: OS, Rust version, cryptographic setup, and any other relevant details
5. **Proof of Concept**: If possible, include a minimal code example that demonstrates the issue

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Regular Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress
- **Resolution**: We will work with you to resolve the issue and coordinate disclosure

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 5 business days

## Security Considerations

### Quantum Shield Specific Concerns

When reporting vulnerabilities, please consider:

1. **Cryptographic Security**: Weaknesses in cryptographic algorithms
2. **Key Management**: Exposure of private keys
3. **Side-Channel Attacks**: Timing attacks, power analysis
4. **Implementation Vulnerabilities**: Bugs in cryptographic implementations
5. **Performance**: DoS through resource exhaustion
6. **Memory Safety**: Unsafe memory operations or buffer overflows

### Attack Vectors

Common attack vectors to test:

- **Private Key Exposure**: Leaked or weak private keys
- **Side-Channel Attacks**: Timing attacks, power analysis
- **Cryptographic Weaknesses**: Algorithm vulnerabilities
- **Implementation Bugs**: Bugs in cryptographic code
- **Resource Exhaustion**: DoS through resource consumption
- **Memory Attacks**: Buffer overflows, use-after-free
- **Key Recovery**: Recovery of private keys

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Secure Private Keys**: Store private keys securely
2. **Use Strong Randomness**: Use cryptographically secure random number generation
3. **Keep the library updated** to the latest version
4. **Monitor for security advisories**
5. **Implement proper access controls**
6. **Use hardware security modules** for critical applications

### For Developers

1. **Test with malicious inputs** regularly
2. **Implement defense in depth**
3. **Use the library correctly** according to documentation
4. **Consider additional validation** for critical applications
5. **Monitor security updates**
6. **Implement proper key management**

## Security Features

### Built-in Protections

- **NIST Standards**: FIPS 203, FIPS 204 compliance

## Security Updates

### How We Handle Security Issues

1. **Assessment**: We assess the severity and impact
2. **Fix Development**: We develop a fix in private
3. **Testing**: We thoroughly test the fix
4. **Release**: We release the fix with a security advisory
5. **Disclosure**: We coordinate disclosure with reporters

### Security Advisories

Security advisories are published on:

- **GitHub Security Advisories**: https://github.com/redasgard/quantum-shield/security/advisories
- **Crates.io**: Security notices in release notes
- **Email**: Subscribers to security@redasgard.com

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Reporting**: Report vulnerabilities privately first
2. **Coordinated Disclosure**: We coordinate disclosure timing
3. **Credit**: We give credit to security researchers
4. **No Legal Action**: We won't take legal action against good faith research

## Security Research
