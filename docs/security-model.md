# Security Model

## Overview

Quantum Shield provides hybrid quantum-resistant cryptography with defense-in-depth through dual independent layers: classical (RSA-4096) and post-quantum (Kyber-1024, Dilithium5).

## Security Level

**NIST Level 5** - Equivalent to AES-256 security (256-bit security parameter)

This is the highest standardized security level, suitable for:
- Top Secret government data
- Long-term classified information
- High-value financial data
- Critical infrastructure

## Threat Model

- Brute force attacks (2^256 complexity)
- Cryptanalysis of RSA-4096
- Meet-in-the-middle attacks
- Birthday attacks
- Known plaintext attacks
- Chosen ciphertext attacks (via OAEP/GCM)

‚úÖ **Quantum Attacks**
- Shor's algorithm (breaks RSA, protected by Kyber)
- Grover's algorithm (weakens symmetric crypto, mitigated by AES-256)
- Quantum cryptanalysis of lattice problems (current unknowns)

‚úÖ **Protocol Attacks**
- Replay attacks (via nonces)

- Concurrent access issues (Send + Sync bounds)

### NOT Protected Against

‚ùå **Side-Channel Attacks**

**Mitigation:** Use constant-time implementations in production, HSMs for sensitive keys

‚ùå **Key Management Issues**
- Weak random number generation
- Insecure key storage
- Key exposure through logs/dumps
- Social engineering for keys

**Mitigation:** Proper key storage, access controls, key rotation policies

‚ùå **Protocol Misuse**
- Using same nonce twice
- Encrypting authentication tokens
- Missing signature verification
- Incorrect key usage

**Mitigation:** Follow API correctly, use high-level abstractions

‚ùå **Endpoint Compromise**
- Malware on client/server
- Keyloggers
- Memory dumps
- Root/admin access attacks

**Mitigation:** Endpoint security, anti-malware, least privilege

‚ùå **Post-Quantum Unknowns**
- Undiscovered attacks on lattice problems
- Future quantum algorithms beyond Shor/Grover
- Mathematical breakthroughs

**Mitigation:** Hybrid approach hedges against this risk

## Cryptographic Guarantees

### Confidentiality

**Guarantee:** Ciphertext reveals no information about plaintext to any attacker without private keys.

**Formal:** `Pr[A(encrypt(m0)) = m0] ‚â§ Pr[A(encrypt(m1)) = m0]` for random m0, m1

**Strength:** Security = MAX(RSA-4096 security, Kyber-1024 security)
- RSA-4096: 2^128 classical security
- Kyber-1024: 2^256 quantum security
- Combined: 2^256 against all known attacks

### Authenticity

**Guarantee:** Valid signatures can only be created by holder of private signing keys.

**Formal:** `Pr[A() ‚Üí (m, œÉ) where verify(m, œÉ, pk) = true] ‚â§ negligible`

**Strength:** Both RSA-4096-PSS AND Dilithium5 must be broken
- RSA-4096-PSS: 2^128 classical security
- Dilithium5: 2^256 quantum security
- Combined: MIN(RSA security, Dilithium security) but requires breaking both

### Integrity

**Guarantee:** Any modification to ciphertext is detected with overwhelming probability.

**Mechanism:**
- AES-GCM provides authenticated encryption (AEAD)
- Signature verification ensures message integrity
- Nonces prevent replay attacks

**Strength:** 2^128 forgery resistance (GCM authentication tag)

### Forward Secrecy

**Current:** ‚ùå Not provided (uses long-term keys)

**Future:** Planned for v0.2 with ephemeral key exchange

**Workaround:** Implement Diffie-Hellman key exchange at application level, use Quantum Shield for the exchanged keys

## Hybrid Security Proof

### Theorem

The hybrid cryptosystem is secure if at least one layer is secure.

### Proof Sketch

**Encryption:**
```
Security(Hybrid) = Security(AES) ‚àß MAX(Security(RSA), Security(Kyber))
```

- AES key encrypted by both RSA and Kyber
- Adversary must break AES AND (RSA OR Kyber)
- If RSA broken, Kyber protects
- If Kyber broken, RSA protects
- Must break both to compromise

**Signatures:**
```
Security(Hybrid) = MIN(Security(RSA-PSS), Security(Dilithium))
```

- Message signed by both RSA-PSS and Dilithium
- Both signatures must verify
- If one broken, other still provides authenticity
- Must break both to forge

### Conclusion

Hybrid approach provides maximum security against known and unknown threats.

## Security Audits

### Current Status

‚ö†Ô∏è **No professional security audit completed**

### Recommendations

Before production deployment:
1. Professional cryptographic audit

3. Code review by crypto experts
4. Fuzzing and vulnerability scanning

### Responsible Disclosure

Security vulnerabilities: security@redasgard.com

**DO NOT** open public GitHub issues for vulnerabilities.

## Known Limitations

### 1. No Forward Secrecy

Long-term keys used for all operations. If private key compromised, all past communications compromised.

**Impact:** High for long-term secrets
**Mitigation:** Implement ephemeral key exchange, rotate keys regularly

### 2. No Key Rotation

Manual key rotation required.

**Impact:** Medium
**Mitigation:** Application-level key rotation policies

### 3. No Key Revocation

No built-in certificate revocation mechanism.

**Impact:** Medium
**Mitigation:** Implement revocation lists at application level

### 4. Side-Channel Vulnerabilities

Implementation may leak information through timing, power, etc.

**Impact:** High for physical access scenarios
**Mitigation:** Use HSMs, constant-time implementations

### 5. Large Signature Size

~4.5KB signatures (Dilithium5 overhead).

**Impact:** Low (bandwidth/storage)
**Mitigation:** Accept as cost of quantum resistance
